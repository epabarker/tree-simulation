# Status

_Last updated: 2026-10-28 (M24)_

**Current milestone: release M24** (the wide plate and leaf studies; branch `claude/m24-plate` in both repos), then M25 (new species). edbarker.dev runs garden-v0.9.0.

## Works
- **Core:** C1–C6, R1–R6, O2 and O4 (ADRs 0005–0013); the sky sweep with open or periodic sides; golden hashes. `World.discardDead` for long page runs.
- **Species** (`src/core/flora.ts`): silver birch, pedunculate oak, beech and silver fir, with field-guide names. Presets `oakOpen` (Plate II), the four woods and `succession` (birch → beech emerges; oak dwindles). The garden's `forestParams` is the succession woodland; `specimen: "oak"` swaps in Plate II's own oak (worker `swap`).
- **Presets:** `skyStand`, `skyGrove`, `skyTree`, `forest`, `thinning`, `weeping`, `troll`; species `conifer`, `birch` and `tropical`, still without R1, R3, R4 and R5.
- **Garden** (`src/web/garden.ts`, ADR 0014):
  - `mountGarden(host, options)`, the living view the lab and the home page share;
  - `npm run build:garden` (43.8 kB gzip, gate 60 kB);
  - M15: Scene work once per snapshot (a frame is 0.07 ms for the forest), pipelined seasons, adaptive quality, `?bench` (lab and `garden.html`);
  - a release workflow on `garden-v*` tags;
  - `garden.html` demo.
- **Lab:** WebGL2 with pseudo-depth, Tweakpane, charts, tap to fell, phone layout. **Headless:** `npm run sim`, `npm run bench` (rings 3.8 ms a season), `analysis/experiments/` m0–m11.

## Next
1. **Release** `garden-v0.10.0` on the user's go-ahead after the preview. Then **M25**: holly, rowan, hornbeam, goat willow and field maple for the home forest, and Scots pine for the lab. A later idea: a magnifying loupe over the plate (true-scale leaves).
2. **The user:** an hour's soak on a phone (heat, memory); the site's `TODO(Ed)` items.
3. **Follow-ups:** rooting in windthrow.

## Open questions (ask when the milestone comes up)
- None open.

## Parked (user, 2026-10-27; raise again only when asked)
- The Pages demo URL is unreachable (`barker.garden` NXDOMAIN; `edbarker.dev/lab` works around it). Delete the early `runs/` and `dist/` copies on pCloud?

## Known issues
- R5 reads self-shade; breakage never fires; sagging limbs can sink below the ground; in the lab, ring crowns cross the seam beyond the edge (the garden wraps them). Bimodality is marginal; K = 7 puts the crown base ≈ 7 cells low.

## Notes for the next session
- **Site deploys:** Cloudflare Workers Builds. A push to `main` goes to production; another branch gets a preview URL, `<branch>-edbarker-dev.edbarker.workers.dev`. A new garden means tag `garden-vX.Y.Z` here, then `node scripts/sync-garden.mjs X.Y.Z` there.
- **Golden-safe means bit-identical.** Check with goldens and `npm run bench -- --compare runs/bench/<sha>.json`.
- **Site loader:** it must stay `is:inline`, because bundling breaks the run-time `import()`. In `.astro` text, break lines inside tags, never next to them (HTML compression eats the space).
- **Headless checks:** puppeteer-core with system Firefox. Reduced motion needs `extraPrefsFirefox: {"ui.prefersReducedMotion": 1}`, since CDP emulation is unsupported. `garden.html` and the lab expose `window.garden`. Firefox rounds `performance.now()` to 1 ms; time per-frame work with `node src/web/render/scene.bench.ts`.
